# TODO

- [ ] Multiple archive folders — support `archive/2024/`, `archive/2023/` etc. for better organization over time
- [ ] Deduplication — if the same order appears in both active and archive, show it only once
- [ ] Price formatting — unify EUR comma format between Python and JS sides
- [ ] Sort by date on archived items — parse actual year from "Received at 5 September 2017" instead of assuming 2026
